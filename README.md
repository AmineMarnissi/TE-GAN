## This implementation for our ICPR 2020 paper, training YOLOv3 on KAIST dataset with Task-conditioned network for Pedestrian Detection task in Thermal Domain.

### This implementation was expanded from our previous work which was the Best Student Paper Honorable Mention Award <a href="https://github.com/mrkieumy/YOLOv3_PyTorch"> "Domain Adaptation for Privacy-Preserving Pedestrian Detection in Thermal Imagery" </a> .
